# Coat of Arms (COA) Elements

## Mandatory Elements:

### 1. Shield:
   - The central and most prominent part of the COA.
   - Displays various heraldic charges, divisions, and tinctures.

### 2. Tinctures:

   Essential for describing the colors and metals used in the COA. Primary tinctures include:

   - Gules: Red
   - Azure: Blue
   - Vert: Green
   - Or: Gold or Yellow
   - Argent: Silver or White
   - Purpure: Purple
   - Sable: Black

   Optional or Less Common Tinctures:

   - Tenne (Tawny or Orange): Occasionally used, but less common.
   - Sanguine (Blood Red): Rarely used in traditional heraldry.
   - Carnation (Flesh Tone): Extremely rare and typically only seen in specific contexts.
   - Murrey (Mulberry or Dark Red): Very rare and seldom used.
   - Celeste (Sky Blue): Uncommon and usually reserved for specific modern heraldic uses.
   - Cendrée (Ash Gray): Rarely encountered and generally non-traditional.

   Additionally, in heraldry, you may encounter several other tinctures, primarily in continental heraldry:

   - Colours
   - Stains
   - Furs
   - Ermine
   - Vair

   Some other tinctures occasionally used in continental heraldry include:

   - Cendrée: or "ash-colour."
   - Brunâtre (Ger. Braun): or brown, occasionally used in German heraldry, in place of purpure.
   - Bleu-céleste or bleu de ciel: a sky blue color intended to be lighter than azure.
   - Amaranth or columbine: a strong violet-red, found in at least one grant of arms to a Bohemian knight in 1701.
   - Eisen-farbe: or iron-color, found in German heraldry.
   - Carnation: often used in French heraldry as the color of white human skin.

#### Rule of Tincture and Counterchanging

The first so-called "rule" of heraldry is the **rule of tincture:** metal should not be placed upon metal, nor color upon color, for the sake of contrast.

The main duty of a heraldic device is to be recognized, and the dark colors or light metals are supposed to be too difficult to distinguish if they are placed on top of other dark or light colors, particularly in poor light. Though this is the practical genesis of the rule, the rule is technical, and appearance is not used in determining whether arms conform to the rule.

Another reason sometimes given to justify this rule is that it was difficult to paint enamel colors over other enamel colors, or with metal over metal.

This "rule" has at times been followed so pedantically that arms that violate it were called **armes fausses** "false arms" or **armes à enquérir** "arms of inquiry"; any violation was presumed to be intentional, to the point that one was supposed to inquire how it came to pass. One of the most famous armes à enquérir was the shield of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, which had gold crosses on silver. This use of white and gold together is also seen on the arms of the King of Jerusalem, the flag and arms of the Vatican, and the bishop's mitre in the arms of Andorra. These uses of gold on silver indicate the exceptional holy and special status of these coats of arms. An example of "colour on colour" is the arms of Albania, with its sable two-headed eagle on a gules field.

The "rule of tincture" has had an influence reaching far beyond heraldry. It has been applied to the design of flags, so that the flag of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach was modified to conform to the rule.

When a charge or group of charges is placed across a division line, variation, or ordinary, it may be **counterchanged** (Fr. *contre-changé*, but modern *de l'un en l'autre*, Ger. *verwechselte Farben* or *verschränkte Farben*), meaning that the charges are divided the same way as the field upon which they rest, with the colors reversed.

In Scottish heraldry, charges are sometimes blazoned as counterchanged of different colors from the field – for instance, *per fess gules and azure, a sun in splendour counterchanged or and of the first*. A more typical blazon for this would be *per fess gules and azure, a sun in splendour per fess or and of the first*.

The term *countercoloured* is sometimes used in place of *counterchanged*. The arms of the Fenwick baronets were originally blazoned as silver, a chief gules with six martlets countercoloured. In this case, three martlets argent rest on a chief gules, while three martlets gules rest on the argent field. Some heraldic authorities regard the use of this term as erroneous.

### 3. Charges:
   - Symbols or objects placed on the shield.
   - Can include animals, plants, weapons, mythical creatures, geometric shapes, etc.
   - At least one charge is typically present on the shield.

### 4. Ordinaries:
   - Simple geometric shapes or lines used for division or decoration.
   - Choose one or more as needed:
     - Chief (horizontal band at the top of the shield)
     - Pale (vertical band from top to bottom)
     - Fess (horizontal band in the center of the shield)
     - Bend (diagonal band top-left to bottom-right)
     - Saltire (diagonal cross)
     - Cross (vertical and horizontal lines crossing in the center)
     - Chevron (inverted V shape)
     - Bordure (border around the edge)
     - Orle (narrower border not touching the edge)

## Optional Elements:

### 5. Supporters:
   - Two figures, often animals or people, placed on either side of the shield.
   - They hold up the shield and are seen in more elaborate or official COAs.

### 6. Crest:
   - A decorative element placed on top of a helmet (if included).
   - Can include various symbols, animals, or objects.
   - Used to distinguish different branches of a family or individuals.

### 7. Helmet:
   - Optional but can indicate rank or social status.
   - Typically placed above the crest (if included).

### 8. Mantling:
   - A decorative cloak or drapery flowing from the helmet (if included).
   - Both decorative and practical, protecting the helmet from sun and rain.

### 9. Motto:
   - Optional phrase or slogan displayed on a ribbon beneath the shield.
   - Conveys a message, family values, or sentiments.

### 10. Compartment:
   - Optional ground or terrain on which supporters stand.

## Additional Considerations:

- Research heraldic rules and traditions specific to your region or lineage.
- Consult with a heraldic expert or authority for guidance.
- Ensure your design is unique and distinct from existing coats of arms.
- Assign appropriate symbolism and meaning to your chosen elements.
- Be mindful of the rules governing the use and display of coats of arms in your jurisdiction.

Remember that the design of a coat of arms should be a reflection of the individual, family, or entity it represents and should adhere to heraldic principles and traditions.

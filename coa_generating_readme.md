# Coat of Arms (COA) Elements

## Elements of a Heraldic Achievement Summarized

   A heraldic achievement consists of a **shield of arms** (coat of arms), which is the central element. The term "coat of arms" is often used to refer to the entire achievement, but technically, it refers to the shield itself.

### Essential Elements:

   1. **Crest (Crest of Arms):** A decorative element often placed above the shield, frequently incorporating elements from the shield of arms.
   2. **Supporters (Heraldic Supporters):** Heraldic figures standing alongside or behind the shield, commonly seen among the nobility.
   3. **Motto (Heraldic Motto):** A phrase or slogan, typically displayed on a ribbon below the shield.
   4. **Helmet (Heraldic Helmet):** Borne of right and forms no part of a grant of arms; it may be assumed by anyone entitled to bear arms, along with mantling and a chosen motto.
   5. **Torse (Heraldic Coronet):** A twisted wreath or coronet from which the crest arises.
   6. **Mantling (Heraldic Mantling):** A decorative cloak or drapery flowing from the helmet.

### Additional Elements (Rarely Found):

   - **Coronet (Heraldic Coronet):** Sometimes used instead of the torse or as an additional embellishment.
   - **Compartment (Supporter's Compartment):** Often a mound of earth and grass on which other badges, symbols, or heraldic banners may be displayed.
   - **Pavilion (Heraldic Pavilion):** An embellished tent or canopy, very rarely found in English or Scots achievements.
   - **Ribbon, Collar, or Badge:** If entitled to a knightly order, it may encircle or depend from the shield.

   The *shield/division* is the indispensable core of any coat of arms, and many ancient arms consist of the shield alone. Other elements, such as the crest, supporters, and motto, are often added to create a complete heraldic achievement. The crest and torse require approval from the relevant heraldic authority.

## Mandatory Elements:

### 1. Shield/Division (Heraldic Shield/Division):
   - The central and most prominent part of the COA.
   - Displays various heraldic charges, divisions, and tinctures.

#### Division of the Shield in Heraldry

   The field of a shield in heraldry can be divided into more than one tincture, as can the various heraldic charges. Many coats of arms consist simply of a division of the field into two contrasting tinctures. These are considered divisions of a shield, so the rule of tincture can be ignored.

   - For example, a shield divided azure and gules would be perfectly acceptable.
   - A line of partition may be straight or it may be varied.
   - The variations of partition lines can be wavy, indented, embattled, engrailed, nebuly, or made into myriad other forms; see Line (heraldry).

### 2. Tinctures (Colors and Metals):

   Essential for describing the colors and metals used in the COA. Primary tinctures include:

   - **Gules:** Red
   - **Azure:** Blue
   - **Vert:** Green
   - **Or:** Gold or Yellow
   - **Argent:** Silver or White
   - **Purpure:** Purple
   - **Sable:** Black

   Optional or Less Common Tinctures:

   - **Tenne (Tawny or Orange):** Occasionally used, but less common.
   - **Sanguine (Blood Red):** Rarely used in traditional heraldry.
   - **Carnation (Flesh Tone):** Extremely rare and typically only seen in specific contexts.
   - **Murrey (Mulberry or Dark Red):** Very rare and seldom used.
   - **Celeste (Sky Blue):** Uncommon and usually reserved for specific modern heraldic uses.
   - **Cendrée (Ash Gray):** Rarely encountered and generally non-traditional.

   Additionally, in heraldry, you may encounter several other tinctures, primarily in continental heraldry:

   - Colours
   - Stains
   - Furs
   - Ermine
   - Vair

   Some other tinctures occasionally used in continental heraldry include:

   - Cendrée: or "ash-colour."
   - Brunâtre (Ger. Braun): or brown, occasionally used in German heraldry, in place of purpure.
   - Bleu-céleste or bleu de ciel: a sky blue color intended to be lighter than azure.
   - Amaranth or columbine: a strong violet-red, found in at least one grant of arms to a Bohemian knight in 1701.
   - Eisen-farbe: or iron-color, found in German heraldry.
   - Carnation: often used in French heraldry as the color of white human skin.

#### Rule of Tincture and Counterchanging

   The first so-called "rule" of heraldry is the **rule of tincture:** metal should not be placed upon metal, nor color upon color, for the sake of contrast.

   The main duty of a heraldic device is to be recognized, and the dark colors or light metals are supposed to be too difficult to distinguish if they are placed on top of other dark or light colors, particularly in poor light. Though this is the practical genesis of the rule, the rule is technical, and appearance is not used in determining whether arms conform to the rule.

   Another reason sometimes given to justify this rule is that it was difficult to paint enamel colors over other enamel colors, or with metal over metal.

   This "rule" has at times been followed so pedantically that arms that violate it were called **armes fausses** "false arms" or **armes à enquérir** "arms of inquiry"; any violation was presumed to be intentional, to the point that one was supposed to inquire how it came to pass. One of the most famous armes à enquérir was the shield of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, which had gold crosses on silver. This use of white and gold together is also seen on the arms of the King of Jerusalem, the flag and arms of the Vatican, and the bishop's mitre in the arms of Andorra. These uses of gold on silver indicate the exceptional holy and special status of these coats of arms. An example of "colour on colour" is the arms of Albania, with its sable two-headed eagle on a gules field.

  The "rule of tincture" has had an influence reaching far beyond heraldry. It has been applied to the design of flags, so that the flag of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach was modified to conform to the rule.

   When a charge or group of charges is placed across a division line, variation, or ordinary, it may be **counterchanged** (Fr. *contre-changé*, but modern *de l'un en l'autre*, Ger. *verwechselte Farben* or *verschränkte Farben*), meaning that the charges are divided the same way as the field upon which they rest, with the colors reversed.

   In Scottish heraldry, charges are sometimes blazoned as counterchanged of different colors from the field – for instance, *per fess gules and azure, a sun in splendour counterchanged or and of the first*. A more typical blazon for this would be *per fess gules and azure, a sun in splendour per fess or and of the first*.

   The term *countercoloured* is sometimes used in place of *counterchanged*. The arms of the Fenwick baronets were originally blazoned as silver, a chief gules with six martlets countercoloured. In this case, three martlets argent rest on a chief gules, while three martlets gules rest on the argent field. Some heraldic authorities regard the use of this term as erroneous.

### 3. Charges:
   - Heraldic objects or figures placed on a shield or armorial composition.
   - They can represent any object from nature or technology.
   - Common charges include animals, objects, and geometric shapes.
   - The cross, lion, eagle, bear, stag, wild boar, martlet, wolf, and fish are frequently used charges.
   - Mythical creatures like dragons, bats, unicorns, and griffins are also used.
   - Charges can appear in various positions or attitudes, such as rampant, passant, and displayed.
   - A pair of wings conjoined is called a vol.
   - In English heraldry, additional marks like crescents, mullets, martlets, annulets, fleurs-de-lis, and roses can be added to shields to distinguish cadet branches of a family from the senior line. These marks are usually smaller than normal charges.

### 4. Ordinaries:
   - Simple geometric shapes or lines used for division or decoration.
   - Choose one or more as needed:
     - Chief (horizontal band at the top of the shield)
     - Pale (vertical band from top to bottom)
     - Fess (horizontal band in the center of the shield)
     - Bend (diagonal band top-left to bottom-right)
     - Saltire (diagonal cross)
     - Cross (vertical and horizontal lines crossing in the center)
     - Chevron (inverted V shape)
     - Bordure (border around the edge)
     - Orle (narrower border not touching the edge)

   In the early days of heraldry, simple bold shapes were painted on shields for easy recognition and identification.[81] These bold shapes, known as "honourable ordinaries," include the cross, fess, pale, bend, chevron, saltire, and pall. They act as charges and are essential in blazon. Sub-ordinaries, like the inescutcheon, orle, tressure, bordure, chief, canton, label, and flaunches, are geometrical shapes subordinate to ordinaries, varying by their order in blazon.[83]

   Ordinaries may appear in parallel series, referred to as pallets, bars, bendlets, and chevronels in English blazon, while French blazon doesn't distinguish diminutives from ordinaries when borne singly. Unless specified otherwise, ordinaries have straight lines but can also be indented, embattled, wavy, engrailed, or feature varied lines.

## Optional Elements:

### 5. Marshalling:

   Marshalling is the practice of combining two or more coats of arms in one shield to signify inheritance, property claims, or office occupation. This can be achieved through various methods:

   - **Impalement:** Dividing the field per pale and placing one whole coat in each half. It replaced the earlier dimidiation, which could create ambiguity.

   - **Quartering:** Dividing the field using both vertical and horizontal lines, with quarters numbered from the dexter chief. The quarters correspond to the ancestors from whom the bearer inherited arms.

   - **Inescutcheon:** A small shield placed in front of the main shield, often indicating the heraldic heiress in British arms or carrying the ancestral arms of a monarch or noble in continental Europe.

   In German heraldry, animate charges in combined coats typically face the center of the composition.

### 6. Supporters:
   - Two figures, often animals or people, placed on either side of the shield.
   - They hold up the shield and are seen in more elaborate or official COAs.

### 7. Crest:
   - A decorative element placed on top of a helmet (if included).
   - Can include various symbols, animals, or objects.
   - Used to distinguish different branches of a family or individuals.

### 8. Helmet:
   - Optional but can indicate rank or social status.
   - Typically placed above the crest (if included).

   #### Helm and Crest

    - The *crest*, often confused with the entire heraldic achievement, is just one part of it.
    - It rests on top of a helmet, which, in turn, rests on the most crucial part, the shield.
      - A crest is a three-dimensional figure used for identification, initially placed on knights' helms.
      - Women traditionally do not display crests, but exceptions exist in some heraldic jurisdictions.
      - The crest is usually found on a wreath and sometimes within a coronet.
      - *Mantling*, originally a cloth for sun protection, takes the form of a stylized cloak today.

### 9. Mantling:
   - A decorative cloak or drapery flowing from the helmet (if included).
   - Both decorative and practical, protecting the helmet from sun and rain.

### 10. Motto/Mottoes:
   - Optional phrase or slogan displayed on a ribbon beneath the shield.
   - Conveys a message, family values, or sentiments. 
   - A motto is a phrase describing the motivation or intention of the person or entity with arms.
   - Mottoes don't form an integral part of the armorial achievement and can be changed at will.
   - In Scottish heraldry, the motto is often shown on a scroll above the crest and cannot be changed easily.
   - Mottoes can be in any language and are typically found on a scroll under the shield.

### 11. Compartment:
   - Optional ground or terrain on which supporters stand.

### 12. Supporters and Other Insignia:

   - Supporters are figures, animals, or objects on either side of a coat of arms.
   - Strict guidelines often govern their use by specific social classes, with fewer restrictions on the European continent.
   - In the UK, only certain individuals and corporate bodies are granted supporters.
   - Titles like baron or hereditary knight may allow the display of a coronet of rank.
   - Insignia of baronets or orders of knighthood can be represented by a collar or band surrounding the shield.
   - When showing the arms of a knight and wife in one achievement, the husband's arms have the insignia of knighthood, and the wife's arms have an ornamental garland.

### 13. Differencing and Cadency:

   - To distinguish the arms of siblings and extended family members, differencing and cadency systems are used.
   - These systems vary, with different methods and rules employed.

### 14. Blazon:

   - *Blazoning arms* means describing them using the formal language of heraldry.
   - It has its own vocabulary and syntax, crucial for understanding complex coat of arms descriptions.
   - Blazon includes a description of the shield, crest, supporters, motto, and other insignia.
   - Complex rules, like the rule of tincture, govern the physical and artistic aspects of newly created arms.
   - A thorough understanding of these rules is vital in the art of heraldry.
   - Different national styles have developed over time, ranging from simple to highly complex heraldic forms.

## Additional Considerations:

- Research heraldic rules and traditions specific to your region or lineage.
- Consult with a heraldic expert or authority for guidance.
- Ensure your design is unique and distinct from existing coats of arms.
- Assign appropriate symbolism and meaning to your chosen elements.
- Be mindful of the rules governing the use and display of coats of arms in your jurisdiction.

Remember that the design of a coat of arms should be a reflection of the individual, family, or entity it represents and should adhere to heraldic principles and traditions.

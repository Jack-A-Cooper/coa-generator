# This class could be used by the main.py to create and manipulate the image
# Based on the generated elements from coat_of_arms.py

# Example usage:
# renderer = Renderer()
# renderer.render_shield(division, tinctures)
# renderer.render_charges(charges)
# renderer.render_ordinaries(ordinaries)
# renderer.render_helm_mantling_crest(helm, mantling, crest)
# renderer.render_motto(motto)
# renderer.save_image('path/to/save/image.png')
